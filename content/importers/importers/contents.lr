title: Importers

body:

Taiga importers are designed to ease the migration of data from others
platforms, and try to keep as much data as possible (including history and
comments, when it is available), to ensure you don't miss anything when you
bring your project into Taiga.

Currently we have 4 importers:

  * [Trello](/importers/trello-importer)
  * [Jira 7](/importers/jira-importer)
  * [Github](/importers/github-importer)
  * [Asana](/importers/asana-importer)
